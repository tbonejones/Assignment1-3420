A Developer submits a Software Package to a process which interacts with other processes to scan the Software Package for licensing and
vulnerability information as well as both store that information in a database and send it to the Developer. Developers and Managers
can use a process to submit queries to that database at any time in order to view the licensing and vulnerability information for
Software Projects, which are Software Packages bundled together for a project. The Developer and Manager can also access the company's
software policies through a query process in order to compare the licensing and vulnerabilities information with the company's policy
on acceptable licensing and vulnerabilities for software used for various company purposes.
