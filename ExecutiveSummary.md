# Executive Summary

This company wants to be aware of all licensing for any open source software they use so that they can comply with that 
licensing or choose not to use the software. They also want to be aware of any known vulnerabilities in any open source software. 
In addition, they want to be able to compare the licensing and vulnerabilities in open sourse software with their policies to determine whether 
or not to use the software.

Particlar to the system, a developer submits a software package to a process which interacts with other processes to scan the software package for licensing and
vulnerability information as well as both store that information in a database and send it to the developer. Developers and managers
can use a process to submit queries to that database at any time in order to view the licensing and vulnerability information for
software projects. The developer and manager can also access the company's
software policies through a query process. The software's licensing and vulnerabilities information can then be compared with the
company's policy regarding acceptable software licenses and vulnerability levels for software used in a specific way (i.e. internally, 
externally, commercial release, etc.).

(Finally, the manager can create and update policy...)
