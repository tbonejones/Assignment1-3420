### Developer: 
&emsp;&emsp; The employee who procures/compiles Software Package and, after it is checked for OSS Licenses, then modifies it for use <br/>&emsp;&emsp; within the company.

### Known Vulnerabilities:
&emsp;&emsp;The results of a RSPN search on the NIST Vulnerabilities DB. These results are all of the exploitable security flaws/bugs that <br/>&emsp;&emsp;are known publicly and associated with the Software Package.

### Manage Software Package for License and Vulnerabilities Scanning (MSPLVS): 
&emsp;&emsp; The process that accepts the Software Package from the Developer and forwards it to the Scan for Licences process. This <br/>&emsp;&emsp; process also receives the SPLR and sends those results to the OSSLV Database for storage.

### Manager: 
&emsp;&emsp; An upper-level executive at the company who may wish to browse the SPLR.

### NIST Vulnerabilities DB:
&emsp;&emsp;A searchable database maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that iformation about the <br/>&emsp;&emsp;security flaws/bugs in OSS that could be exploited, possibly maliciously. These flaws/bugs could have been identifed and <br/>&emsp;&emsp;made publicly known by anyone.

### OSS Licensing and Vulnerabilities DB (OSSLV): 
&emsp;&emsp;The Database that stores the SPLR and the Known Vulnerabilities.

### Query for Full List of Packages and Corresponding License Information (QFLPCLI): 
&emsp;&emsp;The process that accepts a SPLQ, sends it to the OSSLV Database, receives the SPLR, and forwards the SPLR to the<br/>&emsp;&emsp; Manager's computer so it can be conveniently browsed.

### Refined Sofware Package Name (RSPN):
&emsp;&emsp;The name of the Software Package is refined by the MSPLVS so that the NIST Vulnerabilites database will return specific <br/>&emsp;&emsp;enough results (i.e. specifying which version of Adobe so that results for Adobe software not in the Software Package are <br/>&emsp;&emsp;not returned).

### Scan for Licenses: 
&emsp;&emsp;The process that accepts a Software Package and scans it for open source software licensing language and then sends the <br/>&emsp;&emsp;results of the scan to the MSPLVS.

### Send Refined Software Package Name to NIST Database (SRSPN):
&emsp;&emsp;The process that interfaces with the NIST Vulnerabilites DB in order to submit the RSPN and recieve the Known <br/>&emsp;&emsp;Vulnerabilities.

### Software Package: 
&emsp;&emsp;The cumulative lines of code from all of the software files in the package procurred by the Developer.

### Software Package License Query (SPLQ): 
&emsp;&emsp;A request to recieve the SPLR.

### Software Package License Results (SPLR): 
&emsp;&emsp;The results from the Scan for Licenses process. The SPLR is the Software Package itself as well as data stating which parts of <br/>&emsp;&emsp;the Software Package were found to have an OSS License.
